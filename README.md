# FIND GAMES

This is a platform were you can find games and discover more about them, it was developed based in Reactjs, hooks, react router, CSS-modules and Axios to fetch data from API.

What are the highlights of your logic/code writing style?

I have used the latest features of Reactjs hooks with JavaScript es6, CSS was also used, CSS-module and CSS grid making the layout more responsive and with a clean look, smooth and without many coding lines.

What could you do better in your code next iteration?

Technically for this version we could add some lib to help with the queries and cache information, we could also split more our components, loading in order to change the screen and also include lazy loading in order to load the data slowly.

On the business side of it in mind, we could evolve it for a kind of forum where people could share information and help each other, we could also make an app using React native.
